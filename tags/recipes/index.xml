      <description>A pparently humans have been writing, sharing and storing recipes for their food preparation for quite a long time. The first written recipe (besides beer&amp;rsquo;s appearing in the old Sumerian hymn) dates back thousands of years. I do know nothing about it, but according to a quick search there are many sources where to look into. An interesting finding:  Recipe tablets from the Yale Babylonian Collection, previously thought to contain pharmaceutical formulas, have been decoded by French Assyriologist and gourmet chef Jean Bottero.</description>
