   1. Now the exposition of Yoga is being made. | Now, an exposition of Yoga (is to be made). | Now, at the auspicious moment of transition begins the instruction in the discipline of yoga following the past tradition.  </div>

   2. The restraint of the modifications of the mind-stuff is Yoga. | Yoga is the inhibition of the modifications of the mind. | Yoga is the control of the modifications of the mind-field.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   Yoga è la sospensione delle attività della mente.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   3. Then the Seer (Self) abides in Its own nature. | Then the Seer is established in his own essential and fundamental nature. | Then (upon the dissolution of <i>vrttis</i>) the seer rests in his own true nature.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   In questa dimensione, lo yogi trova dimora in se stesso.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   4. At other times [the self appears to] assume the forms of the mental modifications. | In other states there is assimilation (of the Seer) with the modifications (of the mind). | Elsewhere, identification with the form and nature of <i>vrttis</i>.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   Negli altri stati, egli si identifica con le modificazioni della mente.   </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   5. There are five kinds of mental modifications which are either painful or painless. | The modifications of the mind are five-fold and are painful or not painful. | The <i>vrttis</i> are fivefold (and of two kinds): afflicted, painful and impure, imbued with <i>kleshas (klishta)</i>; and not afflicted, not painful, pure, not imbued with <i>klishas (a-klishta)</i>.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   Le modificazioni della mente sono cinque e possono essere dolorose o non dolorose.   </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   6. They are right knowledge, misconception, verbal delusion, sleep and memory. | (They are) right knowledge, wrong knowledge, fancy, sleep, and memory. | The fivefold <i>vrttis</i> of the mind are: valid proofs, perversive cognition, imaginary cognition, sleep and memory.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   Esse sono: corretta conoscenza, illusione, immaginazione, sonno e memoria.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   7. The sources of right knowledge are direct perception, inference and scriptural testimony. | (Facts of) right knowledge (are based on) direct cognition, inference or testimony. | Direct perception, inference and revealed authority are the three categories of the <i>vrtti</i> called valid proof (<i>pramana</i>).  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   La corretta conoscenza può derivare dalla percezione diretta, dalla deduzione o dalle parole di un illuminato.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   8. Misconception occurs when knowledge of something is not based upon its true form. | Wrong knowledge is a false conception of a thing whose real form does not correspond to such a mistaken conception. | False knowledge without a basis in the nature or form of the respective object is the <i>vrtti</i> called perversive cognition (<i>viparyaya</i>).  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   La conoscenza illusoria deriva da una distorsione della realtà.   </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   9. An image that arises on hearing mere words without any reality [as its basis] is verbal delusion. | An image conjured up by words without any substance behind it is fancy. | Dependent upon a verbal knowledge only but devoid of a real object is the <i>vrtti</i> called imaginary cognition (<i>vikalpa</i>).  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   L’immaginazione è priva di sostanza reale in quanto si fonda su fantasie mentali.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   10. That mental modification supported by cognition of nothingness is sleep. | That modification of the mind which is based on the absence of any content in it is sleep. |  Sleep is the modification or operation of the mind-field resorting to the cognition principle of absence or negation and to the cause thereof.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">  Il sonno è l’assenza di ogni attività di pensiero.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   11. When a mental modification of an object previously experienced and not forgotten comes back to consciousness, that is memory.  | Memory is not allowing an object which has been experienced to escape. | Objects experienced not being lost is the <i>vrtti</i> called memory (<i>smrti</i>).  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   La memoria è la rievocazione di esperienze passate.   </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   12. These mental modifications are restrained by practice and non-attachment. | Their suppression (is brought about) by persistent practice and non-attachment. | The control of those <i>vrttis</i> occurs through practice and dispassion.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   La pratica e il distacco dal desiderio sono i mezzi con cui si realizza il contenimento delle modificazioni della mente.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   13. Of these two, effort toward steadiness of mind is practice. | <i>Abhyasa</i> is the effort of being firmly established in that state (of <i>Citta-Vrtti-Nirodha</i>). | Between those two, practice and dispassion, the endeavour towards stillness and stability (<i>sthiti</i>) of the mind-field is called practice.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   La pratica è la costante ricerca della quiete rispetto alle modificazioni della mente.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   14. Practice becomes firmly grounded when well attended to for a long time, without break and in all earnestness. | It <i>(Abhyasa)</i> becomes firmly grounded on being continued for a long time, without interruption and with reverent devotion. | That practice, however, becomes firm of ground only when pursued and maintained in assiduous and complete observance for a long time, without interruption and with a positive and devout attitude.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   La pratica consapevole e pazientemente ripetuta consente di contenere le modificazioni.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   15. The consciousness of self-mastery in one who is free from craving from objects seen or heard about is non-attachment. | The consciousness of perfect mastery (of desires) in the case of one who has ceased to crave for objects, seen or unseen, is <i>Vairagya</i>. | The mastery established by someone who has lost all craving for the matters of experience or enjoyment, whether perceived with physical senses or heard of in the tradition and scriptures (as of the subtle worlds), is called dispassion.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   Il distacco dal desiderio si realizza attraverso la pratica della rinuncia.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   16. When there is non-thirst for even the <i>guṇas</i> (constituents of Nature) due to the realization of the <i>Puruṣa</i> (True Self), that is supreme non-attachment. | That is the highest <i>Vairagya</i> in which, on account of the awareness of the <i>Purusa</i>, there is cessation of the least desire for the <i>Gunas</i>. | That dispassion is of the higher kind, transcendent, supreme, when it is the freedom from all craving for the attributes, gunas, arising through the realization of the spiritual self, <i>purusha</i>.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   Lo stadio supremo di distacco dal desiderio si realizza quando si trascendono le qualità della natura e si raggiunge la percezione del sé.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   17. <i>Saṁprajñāta samādhi</i> is accompanied by reasoning, reflecting, rejoicing and pure I-am-ness. | <i>Samprajnata Samadhi</i> is that which is accompanied by reasoning, reflection, bliss and sense of pure being. | <i>Samprajiata</i>, the <i>samadhi</i> of wisdom, occurs through the accompaniment of the appearances (RP, BB) of gross thought (<i>vitarka</i>), subtle thought (<i>vichara</i>), ecstasy (<i>ananda</i>) and I-am-ness (<i>asmita</i>).  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   La pratica e il distacco dal desiderio consentono di sperimentare quattro tipi di <i>samādhi</i>: il ragionamento, la riflessione, la beatitudine e la percezione della pura essenza.   </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   18. By the firmly convinced practice of the complete cessation of the mental modifications, the impressions only remain. This is the other samādhi [<i>asaṁprajñāta samādhi</i>].  |  The remnant impression left in the mind on the dropping of the <i>Pratyaya</i> after previous practice is the other (i.e., <i>Asamprajnata Samadhi</i>). | (<i>Asamprajnata</i>) is the other (<i>samadhi</i>), having as its prerequisite the practice of the cognition and causal principle of cessation and leaving its <i>sarhskara</i> as residue.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   Il vuoto che deriva da queste esperienze è un’altra forma di <i>samādhi</i>. Le impressioni non manifeste tendono a rimanere sotto il livello di coscienza, ma possono emergere creando fluttuazioni e disturbando la purezza della consapevolezza di sé.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   19. Those who merely leave their physical bodies and attain the state of celestial deities, or those who get merged in Nature, have rebirth. | Of those who are <i>Videhas</i> and <i>Prakrtilayas</i> birth is the cause. | The <i>samadhi</i> of the bodiless (<i>videha</i>) yogis and of those who have merged into <i>prakrti</i> (<i>prakrti-layas</i>) is called <i>bhava-pratyaya</i>, the <i>samadhi</i> of the causal cognition of being. [Or: <i>Samadhi</i> naturally experienced at rebirth comes to the <i>videha</i> and <i>prakrtilaya</i> yogis. Or: <i>Bhava-pratyaya</i>, the <i>samadhi</i> of the causal cognition of being, accrues to the bodiless (<i>videhas</i>) and to the <i>prakrti</i>- dissolved (<i>prakrti-layas</i>).]  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">    In questo stato, è possibile l’esperienza della trascendenza dal corpo o la fusione con la natura, il che può portare all’isolamento.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   20. For the others, this <i>asaṁprajñāta samādhi</i> could come through faith, vigor, memory, contemplation and/or by discernment. | (In the case) of others <i>(Upaya-Pratyaya Yogis)</i> it is preceded by faith, energy, memory and high intelligence necessary for <i>Samadhi</i>. | The <i>samadhi</i> of (some) others has as its preconditions faith, strength, intentness, meditation and the awakening of wisdom in <i>samprajnata</i>.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   È necessario praticare con fiducia e perseveranza, con concentrazione e ricettività, capacità di discriminazione, forza fisica e morale.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   21. To the keen and intent practitioner this [<i>samādhi</i>] comes very quickly. |  It <i>(Samadhi)</i> is nearest to those whose desire (for Samadhi) is intensely strong. |   </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">  For those whose rate of progress is fast and whose momentum is great, <i>samadhi</i> is very near and even imminent.  </div>  
   <div class="poem-line">   Coloro che si applicano con intensità e determinazione hanno maggiori possibilità di raggiungere lo scopo.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   22. The time necessary for success further depends on whether the practice is mild, medium or intense. |  A further differentiation (arises) by reason of the mild, medium and intense (nature of means employed). | Even from among those of great momentum there is a distinction of the slow, medium and ultimate.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   Le probabilità di successo variano a seconda dei diversi livelli di impegno.   </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   23. Or [<i>samādhi</i> is attained] by devotion with total dedication to <i>Īśvara</i>. |  Or by self-surrender to God. | Or, <i>samadhi</i> can be attained quickly through practising the presence of God.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">    È possibile realizzare lo scopo anche attraverso la rinuncia al frutto delle azioni e la devozione al Divino.  </div> 
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   24. <i>Īśvara</i> is the supreme <i>Puruṣa</i>, unaffected by any afflictions, actions, fruits of actions or by any inner impressions of desires. | <i>Isvara</i> is a particular <i>Purusa</i> who is untouched by the afflictions of life, actions and the results and impressions produced by these actions. | A special <i>purusha</i> not smeared by afflictions, actions, their fruitions and the domains of their accumulated propensities is God.  </div>
   
   
   
    
   <div class="poem-line">   Dio è la realizzazione dell’Essenza Suprema; è un’entità totalmente libera da conflitti. Egli non è influenzato dalle azioni ed è immune dalla concatenazione delle cause e degli effetti.   </div>

   You ask me how I became a madman. It happened thus: One day, long before many gods were born, I woke from a deep sleep and found all my masks were stolen,—the seven masks I have fashioned an worn in seven lives,—I ran maskless through the crowded streets shouting, "Thieves, thieves, the cursed thieves."   </div>
   
   
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   Men and women laughed at me and some ran to their houses in fear of me.   </div>
   
   
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   And when I reached the market place, a youth standing on a house-top cried, "He is a madman." I looked up to behold him; the sun kissed my own naked face for the first time. For the first time the sun kissed my own naked face and my soul was inflamed with love for the sun, and I wanted my masks no more. And as if in a trance I cried, "Blessed, blessed are the thieves who stole my masks."   </div>
   
   
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   Thus I became a madman.   </div>
   
   
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   And I have found both freedom of loneliness and the safety from being understood, for those who understand us enslave something in us.   </div>
   
   
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">

  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   In the stillest hour of the night, as I lay half asleep, my seven selves sat together and thus conversed in whisper:   </div>
   
   
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   First Self: Here, in this madman, I have dwelt all these years, with naught to do but renew his pain by day and recreate his sorrow by night. I can bear my fate no longer, and now I rebel.   </div>
   
   
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   Second Self: Yours is a better lot than mine, brother, for it is given to me to be this madman's joyous self. I laugh his laughter and sing his happy hours, and with thrice winged feet I dance his brighter thoughts. It is I that would rebel against my weary existence.   </div>
   
   
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   Third Self: And what of me, the love-ridden self, the flaming brand of wild passion and fantastic desires? It is I the love-sick self who would rebel against this madman.   </div>
   
   
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   Fourth Self: I, amongst you all, am the most miserable, for naught was given me but odious hatred and destructive loathing. It is I, the tempest-like self, the one born in the black caves of Hell, who would protest against serving this madman.   </div>
   
   
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   Fifth Self: Nay, it is I, the thinking self, the fanciful self, the self of hunger and thirst, the one doomed to wander without rest in search of unknown things and things not yet created; it is I, not you, who would rebel.   </div>
   
   
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   Sixth Self: And I, the working self, the pitiful labourer, who, with patient hands, and longing eyes, fashion the days into images and give the formless elements new and eternal forms—it is I, the solitary one, who would rebel against this restless madman.   </div>
   
   
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   Seventh Self: How strange that you all would rebel against this man, because each and every one of you has a preordained fate to fulfill. Ah! Could I but be like one of you, a self with a determined lot! But I have none, I am the do-nothing self, the one who sits in the dumb, empty nowhere and nowhen, while you are busy re creating life. Is it you or I, neighbours, who should rebel?   </div>
   
   
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
   
   When the seventh self thus spake the other six selves looked with pity upon him but said nothing more; and as the night grew deeper one after the other went to sleep enfolded with a new and happy submission.   </div>
   
   
    
  </div> 
  <div class="poem-stanza">
	 
   
   
   <div class="poem-firstline">
